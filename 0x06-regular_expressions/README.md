# Loops, conditions and parsing
---
Project done during ALX Software Engineering Scholarship 2022 at Alx Students Education. It aims to learn about loops (while, until and for), condition statements (`if`, `else`, `elif` and `case`), shebangs and how to create SSH keys with **Bash**.

# More Info
[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
Shellcheck is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. Shellcheck is your friend! All your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error or you will not get any points on the task.

Shellcheck is available on the schoolâ€™s computers. If you want to use it on your own computer, here is how to install it.

Examples:
